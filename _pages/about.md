I am **Ruoyu Chen**, a recent graduate with a Master's degree from **the University of Edinburgh**, School of Biological Sciences. My research focuses on **Computational Biology**, particularly on 
**protein tagging site prediction using computational methods**.

I am **actively seeking a PhD position**, with a particular interest in **bioinformatics** and **drug discovery**. I am passionate about using computational tools to address biological questions and translational research challenges.

## üíï Research Interest

1. My research interests lie in the **computational analysis of molecular biology**, with a focus on uncovering the mechanisms of genes, proteins, and their interactions. I am particularly interested in developing predictive models to gain insights into complex biological systems.

2. I am also interested in applying these models to **biomedical problems**, such as **genetic variant interpretation**, **target identification**, and **early-stage drug discovery**, by integrating sequence- and structure-based information in a data-driven framework.

  <b>Project 1: Computational prediction of optimal protein tagging sites</b>
  <ul><li>Description: R & Python</li></ul>
  <ol>
    <li>
    In-house computational prediction method TagScore was assessed through benchmarking using DMS data and human clinial insertion data by correlation analysis and ROC/PR analysis, comparing with existing used tolerance metrics pLDDT and RSA.
    </li>
    <li>
    Properties of the proteins predicted by TagScore to prefer N-terminal, C-terminal or internal tagging were explored by the gene enrichment analysis. GTPase-associated proteins were found to possibly prefer internal tagging.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <b>Project 2: Screening of the Protein Phosphatase PPM1B Inhibitors</b>
  <ul><li>Description: PCR & Western Blot & Cell Culture & Inhibitor Screening</li></ul>
  <ol>
    <li>
    Plasmids containting 2p8e mutant were extracted and subjected to PCR validation. Phosphatase PPM1B protein was extracted and purified.
    </li>
    <li>
    39 compunds with preliminary inhibitory effects on PPM1B were confirmed.
    </li>
    <li>
    Compound h3-41f1 with relatively effective inhibition was screened and identified with an IC50 value of 0.38 ŒºM.
